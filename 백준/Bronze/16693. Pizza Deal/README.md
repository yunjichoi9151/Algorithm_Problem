### 문제 설명

<p>There’s a pizza store which serves pizza in two sizes: either a pizza slice, with area A<sub>1</sub> and price P<sub>1</sub>, or a circular pizza, with radius R<sub>1</sub> and price P<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>You want to maximize the amount of pizza you get per dollar. Should you pick the pizza slice or the whole pizza?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains two space-separated integers A<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the second line contains two space-separated integers R<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that all values are positive integers at most 10<sup>3</sup>. We furthermore guarantee that the two will not be worth the same amount of pizza per dollar.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>If the better deal is the whole pizza, print ‘Whole pizza’ on a single line.</p>

<p>If it is a slice of pizza, print ‘Slice of pizza’ on a single line.</p>
